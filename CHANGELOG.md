## upcoming version

- Added ressources configuration for init-spock job, allowing customization of `requests` and `limits` settings

## v0.2.0 - 2026-02-11

### Added

- Added security context configuration for init-spock job, allowing customization of `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `fsGroup`, and `runAsNonRoot` settings (thanks @kevinpthorne)
- Added `extraResources` field to deploy additional Kubernetes resources (NetworkPolicies, PodMonitors, ConfigMaps, etc.) alongside pgEdge with full Helm template evaluation
- Added `internalHostname` configuration option for nodes, allowing in-cluster connection checks while preserving the external hostname for spock configuration (useful when clusters prevent hairpinning)
- Added automated release workflow which manages release notes, builds/pushes Docker images, GPG-signs Helm charts, and creates GitHub releases with prerelease support
- Added pgEdge Helm Repository (https://pgedge.github.io/charts) providing official Helm charts for pgEdge, CloudNativePG, and Barman Cloud plugin with updated documentation recommending this as the primary installation method

### Changed

- init-spock job image now defaults to `ghcr.io/pgedge/pgedge-helm-utils:v<chart-version>` when `initSpockImageName` is not set, eliminating manual version updates during releases
- Improved Helm validation logic so `bootstrap.mode` is only required when `initSpock` is enabled

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate `privateKey` key in client-ca Certificate resource


## v0.1.0 - 2025-12-19

### Added

- Exposed the ability to override the container image used in the init-spock job (thanks @marlenekoh)
- Added documentation describing how to load and configure extensions which are available in the [pgEdge Enterprise Postgres Standard image](https://github.com/pgEdge/postgres-images)

### Changed

- Moved the init-spock job to utilize the [pgedge-helm-utils](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-helm/pkgs/container/pgedge-helm-utils) image instead of downloading python dependencies at runtime
  - The image uses a distroless base image and includes build revision support for versioned releases
  - This enables users to install this chart in on-premise environments, or environments where security controls may have blocked the python dependency installs
- Updated documentation and tests to utilize [CloudNativePG 1.28.0](https://cloudnative-pg.io/releases/cloudnative-pg-1-28.0-released/)

## v0.0.4 - 2025-11-04

### Added

### Changed

- Updated CloudNativePG in docs / tests to use version [1.27.1](https://cloudnative-pg.io/releases/cloudnative-pg-1-27.1-released/)

## v0.0.3 - 2025-10-23

### Changed
